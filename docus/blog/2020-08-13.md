Preparing for public announcement.

Docusaurus does not like block entries with id with more than one dash, eg. id: 2020-08-13 fails.

```bash
id: 2020-08-13

TypeError: Url must be a string. Received object
    at Object.normalizeUrl (/Users/epdev/Desktop/covid19-dashboard/docus/node_modules/@docusaurus/utils/lib/index.js:259:19)
    at Promise.all.blogFiles.map (/Users/epdev/Desktop/covid19-dashboard/docus/node_modules/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog/lib/blogUtils.js:110:36)

```

No id also fails.

```bash
The above error occurred in the <a> component:
