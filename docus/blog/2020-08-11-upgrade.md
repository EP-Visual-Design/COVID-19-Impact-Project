Upgraded to most recent version of Docusaurus to avoid warning - failed, warning still present.
The use of componentWillMount warned about is buried in Docusaurus code that we can't directly modify.

```bash

# Getting following react warning:
react-dom.development.js?61bb:88 Warning: componentWillMount has been renamed, and is not recommended for use. See https://fb.me/react-unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.

* Move code with side effects to componentDidMount, and set initial state in the constructor.
* Rename componentWillMount to UNSAFE_componentWillMount to suppress this warning in non-strict mode. In React 17.x, only the UNSAFE_ name will work. To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names, you can run `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles` in your project source folder.

Please update the following components: LoadableComponent
