Grieved by the lives lost as a result of this pandemic and inspired by the need for disrupting
systems of racial and economic inequality within marginalized communities, we are designing a
crowdsourcing platform for the general public to contribute ideas, share personal stories,
memorialize loved ones, and examine statistics related to our collective COVID-19 experience.

## How?

The COVID-19 Impact Dashboard includes an open source database featuring at-a-glance data that makes
it easy to trace the progression of the pandemic. In addition, we will gather human-centered soft
data contributions in the form of personalized memorials and community voices to influence
political action. By developing a local rendering of the impact of the pandemic over time, we will
be able to motivate and sustain action. We believe we can better assess impact and make change by
seeking input from a wide variety of collaborators, including other coders, designers, journalists,
activists and data artists.

## Why?

The purpose of this project is to provide a “living” platform of crowdsourced information that will enable us to collectively:

- Mourn and memorialize the thousands dying everyday from the COVID-19 pandemic
- Assess the impact on the families and communities of the deceased
- Build enduring institutions to mitigate the suffering caused by the pandemic and address systemic inequalities exposed by the pandemic
