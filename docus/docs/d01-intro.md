Documentation for the [Covid19 Dashboard](https://epvisual.com/covid19-dashboard/a0/) - why and how it's being built.

## Purpose

More than numbers, we hope the Covid19 Dashboard will help contribute to answering these questions:

- How to mourn and memorialize the thousands dying everyday from the COVID-19 pandemic?

- How to assess the impact on the families and the communities of the deceased?

- How to build enduring institutions to mitigate their suffering and address systemic inequalities?
