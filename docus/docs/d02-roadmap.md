The COVID-19 Impact Project is a “living” website reliant on collaboration and contribution from
many sources and is therefore a continuous work-in-progress.

The COVID-19 Impact Project has an open source github repository at  
https://github.com/EP-Visual-Design/COVID-19-Impact-Project.git  
which invites developers to enhance the source code and help fulfil the technical vision for the project

The [COVID-19 Impact Dashboard](https://covid19-impact.net/COVID-19-Impact/Dashboard/) currently displays country-level statistics. The first step in assessing
the impact of this pandemic is to break down the huge numbers we see internationally to local-level
statistics. By opening this up to collaborators, we believe we will be able to analyze the specific
data required to meet this goal.

We invite creatives, designers, artists, activists and journalists
to brainstorm and collaborate with us to develop a visually compelling
digital memorial that will give face and voice to those lost to COVID-19.

Our collective efforts will aid in:

- Enhancing the public repo to drill down to community-level statistics

- Connecting to statistics on essential workers and disproportionately affected communities

- Supporting community-driven mourning and memorialization

- Driving political action to remedy systemic inequalities laid bare by the pandemic from the local to the national level
