A possible vision for memorializing essential workers of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
by Shindy Johnson.

## Summary

The COVID-19 Dashboard is a data driven, crowdsourced website/app
that seeks to memorialize victims of COVID-19
from marginalized communities and advocate
for economic justice for essential workers
particularly from the black, latino and indigenous communities
that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

## Proposal

The raw data representing the devastation of COVID-19 does not capture the human toll and trauma of
this disease, particularly for communities of color. This project seeks to track the appearance and
evolving impact of the virus locally and internationally and correlate it with several data points
including local and national government response and other socioeconomic factors that inform the
impact of the virus on communities in the United States. The project will begin with a global
overview and then hone in on a hyperlocal view of the emotional, psychological, and economic impact
on essential workers and frontline workers and in particular communities of color
which have borne the brunt of the devastation from COVID-19.

### Open Sourced

The project invites collaboration from the software development community at large to
build out and develop the application using vetted data sources from the global to the hyperlocal
levels. This collaboration will begin with the Digital Media program at Drexel University.

### Crowd Sourced

The project will call for submissions of photos and vignettes from family members of
essential workers and other members of the black community to create a meaningful online memorial
of those lost to COVID-19 - a pandemic that precluded traditional mourning and grieving. The
project will make it easy for online submission of stories and remembrances of family members and
those who made important contributions to their local communities. The project will feature an
individual story each week and maintain an archive of personal stories and remembrances.

### Racial Justice

Through data and local stories of those lost to COVID-19, we will seek to amplify the
structural inequalities and the social, emotional and economic ripple effects which this pandemic
has laid bare. We will use the stories and data to humanize the loss and fight for economic justice
for essential workers including:

- Retroactive hazard pay for essential workers still on the job

- Living wage and healthcare and retirement benefits for essential workers

- Compensation for families of essential worker COVID-19 victims who were heads of households
