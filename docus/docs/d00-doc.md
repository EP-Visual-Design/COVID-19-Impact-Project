## Purpose

More than numbers, I hope the site will help contribute to answering these questions:

- How to mourn and memorialize the thousands dying everyday from the COVID-19 pandemic?

- How to assess the impact on the families and the communities of the deceased?

- How to build enduring institutions to mitigate their suffering and address systemic inequalities?
