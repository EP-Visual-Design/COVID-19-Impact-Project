# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

Run in /docus folder

```
yarn
```

### Local Development

```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
# Build and publish docus to epvisual.com
bin/doc-build-pub.sh

open https://jht1493.net/COVID-19-Impact/Project

```

```
# pub to github.io --retired--
GIT_USER=jhtep yarn deploy

open https://ep-visual-design.github.io/COVID-19-Impact/

```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
